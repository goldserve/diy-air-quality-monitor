# DIY Air Quality Monitor

This project contains the software for a DIY air quality monitor based on the Panasonic SN-GCJA5 air quality sensor. This software is designed to run on a [TinyPICO](https://www.tinypico.com) ESP32 development board and be built by PlatformIO in Visual Code Studio.

To use this code, first edit `include/Configuration.h` as needed, then build and upload to the TinyPICO. The Panasonic SN-GCJA5 is connected to the TinyPICO via it's serial connection at pin 33.

*Currently this project very much a work in progress.*
